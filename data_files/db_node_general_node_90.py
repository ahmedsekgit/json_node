problem mongodb v6 dosenot work with v10 of node js  
==============================
tried to update node js to v 14 and v 12 but having problems so
alternative solution is to downgrade mongodb as
npm uninstall mongodb
npm i mongoose@5.8.5
npm start

> nodeapp@0.0.0 start /home/sea/Desktop/node/express_node/nodeapp
> node ./bin/www
