What is/was gksu?  
==============================
gksu was the program that provided a GTK frontend for su and sudo. This way graphical applications 
were allowed to be run with root privileges.

As an end user, you might have used gksu to run Gedit editor for modifying some system files that required root privileges.

Since gksu is no more, what can you do if you need to open a program like Gedit as superuser?
